Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [selectable=true] Allow component to be selected when clicked. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [hoverable=true] Shows a highlight outline when hovering on the element if `true`. Default: `true`\r\n * @property {Boolean} [void=false] This property is used by the HTML exporter as void elements don't have closing tags, eg. `<br/>`, `<hr/>`, etc. Default: `false`\r\n * @property {String} [content=''] Content of the component (not escaped) which will be appended before children rendering.

Default: `''`\r\n * @property {String|Function} [script=''] Component's javascript. More about it [here](/modules/Components-js.html). Default: `''`\r\n * @property {Array<Object|String>} [traits=''] Component's traits. More about it [here](/modules/Traits.html). Default: `['id', 'title']`\r\n * @property {Array<String>} [propagate=[]] Indicates an array of properties which will be inhereted by all NEW appended children.\r\n *  For example if you create a component likes this: `{ removable: false, draggable: false, propagate: ['removable', 'draggable'] }`\r\n *  and append some new component inside, the new added component will get the exact same properties indicated in the `propagate` array (and the `propagate` property itself).

To get better this concept let's take\r\n * a look at this code:\r\n *\r\n * ```css\r\n * span > #send-btn.btn{\r\n *  ...\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * ```html\r\n * <span>\r\n *   <button id=\"send-btn\" class=\"btn\"></button>\r\n * </span>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * In this scenario we get:\r\n * * span     -> selector of type `tag`\r\n * * send-btn -> selector of type `id`\r\n * * btn      -> selector of type `class`\r\n *\r\n * So, for example, being `btn` the same class entity it'll be easier to refactor and track things.\r\n *\r\n * You can customize the initial state of the module from the editor initialization, by passing the following [Configuration Object](https://github.com/artf/grapesjs/blob/master/src/selector_manager/config/config.js)\r\n * ```js\r\n * const editor = grapesjs.init({\r\n *  selectorManager: {\r\n *    // options\r\n *  }\r\n * })\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Once the editor is instantiated you can use its API. Before using these methods you should get the module from the instance\r\n *\r\n * ```js\r\n * const selectorManager = editor.SelectorManager;\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * * [getConfig](#getconfig)\r\n * * [add](#add)\r\n * * [addClass](#addclass)\r\n * * [get](#get)\r\n * * [getAll](#getAll)\r\n *\r\n * @module SelectorManager\r\n */\r\n\r\nimport { isString, isElement, isObject } from 'underscore';\r\n\r\nconst isId = str => isString(str) && str[0] == '#';\r\nconst isClass = str => isString(str) && str[0] == '.';\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = config => {\r\n  var c = config || {},\r\n    defaults = require('./config/config'),\r\n    Selector = require('./model/Selector'),\r\n    Selectors = require('./model/Selectors'),\r\n    ClassTagsView = require('./view/ClassTagsView');\r\n  var selectors, selectorTags;\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    Selector,\r\n\r\n    Selectors,\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Name of the module\r\n     * @type {String}\r\n     * @private\r\n     */\r\n    name: 'SelectorManager',\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Get configuration object\r\n     * @return {Object}\r\n     */\r\n    getConfig() {\r\n      return c;\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Initialize module.
